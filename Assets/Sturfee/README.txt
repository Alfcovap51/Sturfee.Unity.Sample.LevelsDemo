Sturfee StreetAR SDK
version 1.0.0.0 BETA

The StreetAR SDK provides functionality for building immersive outdoor AR experiences. 
Using Sturfee's proprietary Visual Processing System (VPS), the SDK can provide precise localization (position and orientation) through imagery from the device camera.
The VPS provides better accuracy than GPS for localization in geospatial coordinates.
