Sturfee StreetAR Test Tools
version 0.9.2.1 BETA

These Test Tools are designed to work with the StreetAR SDK.
The StreetAR Test Tools help speed up development and testing by allowing developers to use the SDK without having to be physically present in a supported coverage area.
Developers can use these tools to design apps entirely from their desks, couches, coffee shops, etc.
